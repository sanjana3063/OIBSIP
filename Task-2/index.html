    <p align="justify/left">Great personalities are not born every day; they are born once in a century and are<br>
        remembered for millennials to come. One such great personality that we will always <br>
        be proud of is Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, <br>

            <h1>About His Family and Struggle Life</h1>
            <p align="justify/left">Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam was born to a poor Tamil Muslim family. 
            He lived with his family in the temple city of Tamilnadu, 
            Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and
             was an imam of a local mosque. At the same time, his mother, 
             Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one sister 
             in his family, from which he was the youngest. Kalam's 
              were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast land and 
               tracts. But with time, their business of ferrying pilgrims and trading groceries 
               suffered huge losses due to the Pamban Bridge's opening. As a result, Kalam's 
                had become inadequate and struggled hard to make a living. At a tender age, 
                Kalam had to sell newspapers to supplement his family income.</p>
        
            <h1>Educational Background of Kalam </h1>
            <p align="justify/left">Although Kalam had average grades in school, he was very hard working and had an 
                immense desire to learn. He spent a lot of time studying and had developed a particular interest in
                 mathematics. Kalam left Schwartz higher secondary school after completing his early education 
                 and went to Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli. From Saint Joseph's College, 
                 he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering at Madras Institute of Technology.</p>
            <h1>Kalam as the 11th President of India </h1>
            <p>
                Sir Kalam was entitled to be the 11th president of India. His term period of 25th July 2002 
                to 25th July 2007 was achieved by winning a presidential election in 2002 with a massive margin
                 of votes. National Democratic Alliances’ nominated him to be president and it was supported by 
                  Party and National Congress Party. He was lovingly called as peoples’ president as he had 
                   uncountable works for the welfare of the people and through the entire country.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was brave and courageous enough to take decisions and implement them no matter 
                if that was tough or sensitive or highly controversial. The “office of profit” is
                 perhaps the hard Act that he had to sign. The “office of profit”, according to the 
                 English Act of Settlement in 1701 explains that no single individual who has a professional
                  set up under the royal family, who has some kind of provision with or who is taking a 
                  pension from the prince has the right to work for the of the “House of Commons”. This will
                   allow the royal family to have zero influence on the administrative conditions.
            </p>
            <h1>The Demise of Abdul Kalam</h1>
            <p>
                Abdul Kalam was a mortal human being just like us, but for his contribution to 
                the country he remained immortal in the hearts of people. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was
                 one such personality who died at 83. It was shocking news for the entire country 
                 as a pure soul left us forever. Abdul Kalam while delivering a speech for the youth 
                 in an event at IIM Shillong. During the middle of the speech, he suffered from a 
                 cardiac arrest and collapsed. Although he got admitted to the best hospital in Shillong, the doctors could not save him.
